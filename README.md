# manVsBot - a site to test basic strategy

Hi! Thanks for taking a look. This is a javascript website where one can play blackjack online.
Additional features:
- The player plays along with a "bot" which plays according to basic strategy (a set of best course of actions for every scenario which can occur during the game devised by mathematicians).

 - Additional feature is to be able to run simulations with an arbitrary number of bots and iterations playing according to the basic strategy against a dealer.

It is also possible to devise your own basic strategy and test it.

## How to run the website?
It is a php based website with a very simple database located in the "source_files/database" folder, therefore installation, apart from necessary runtimes and importing the database is not necessary. The main idea was to provide statistics on the winnings of visitors, bots and dealers.
However, the site was not hosted or advertised in any way.
